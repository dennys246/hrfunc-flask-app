# hrfunc-flask-app
Code base for supporting a flask website for the hrfunc tool.
The website guides user's to using the HRfunc tool. 
This flask website also connects to a remote flask app via API to 
transmit HRFs estimated from the tool and integrate the HRFs
directly into the HRtree for the wider neuroimaging community.
